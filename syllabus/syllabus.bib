  abstract =	 {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for
                  specifying statistical models. A Stan program
                  imperatively defines a log probability function over
                  parameters conditioned on specified data and
                  constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full
                  Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models
                  through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the
                  No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian
                  Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood
                  estimates are calculated using optimization methods
                  such as the limited memory
                  Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is
                  also a platform for computing log densities and
                  their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in
                  alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes,
                  expectation propagation, and marginal inference
                  using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is
                  set up so that the densities, gradients, and
                  Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the
                  algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are
                  easily accessible. Stan can be called from the
                  command line using the cmdstan package, through R
                  using the rstan package, and through Python using
                  the pystan package. All three interfaces support
                  sampling and optimization-based inference with
                  diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan
                  also provide access to log probabilities, gradients,
                  Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized
                  plotting.},
